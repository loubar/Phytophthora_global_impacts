Rapid removal and destruction of infected trees and removal of old leaves and petioles is needed to prevent infection

It can be detected by severely stunted plants. On warm days, entire plants or outer leaves of plants wilt suddenly (Fig. 5). Older leaves of infected plants become yellow, red, and brown. The root systems of infected plants are devoid of lateral roots, giving larger roots with black tips and a ""rat's tail"" appearance (Fig. 6). When the stele is cut, a red or reddish brown color is seen surrounding the white cortical tissue (Fig. 7). The red discoloration can extend up the root into the crown of the plant. Roots that develop during the summer months do not become infected and the plant can partially recover during the warm season. Oospores form in the root, crown, and leaves and can survive in the soil for many years (Erwin and Ribeiro, 1996).",,,
